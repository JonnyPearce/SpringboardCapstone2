    "## 2.2 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Although cricket may be seen as a niche sport, and is only played in a limited number of countries, it has genuine claims to being a global sport and a major international business. Stemming from Great Britain, and to some extents spread by the former British Empire, cricket is played domestically and internationally by a growing number of countries, although there are clear distinctions between top tier playing nations and those in other tiers. However, the professionalism and commercialisation of the sport is breaking down those distinctions and barriers faster than at another time in the sport. In part this is due to the changing formats of the game. Historically, cricket matches were played over a number of days until they finished (with not set time for completion). This could result in games of significantly varying lengths, from a  couple of days to a couple of weeks (games being based on two innings per side (and 11 players by side), with the winning side being the team with the highest overall score in those two innings). By the end of the Second World War, this practice stopped and the role of broadcasting rights (and associated advertising revenue) has played an increasing role in setting the parameters and formats for the game. So, from the end of the Second World War, international cricket became limited to five days, with an acceptance that there would be an increase in the number of unconcluded, hence drawn games. Over time, pressure to adapt the game an international level, and grow the business of the game has seen different formats emerge, from one-day limited-overs cricket (eg, 40, 50  or 60 overs per side, which is usually manageable within one day) to shorter formats such as T20 (high-intensity, fast-paced 20-over cricket, that is finished within a matter of hours, a form of heresy for older cricket fans brought up on longer, slower and more strategic forms of the game).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the same time, the power base of cricket has moved from England/Great Britain to South Asia, in particular India, where the appeal, popuplarity, market and revenue for all forms of cricket is massive. Globalisation, the internet, cheaper/easier travel have also created internation cricket competitions and formats outside of the historical/traditional competitions where one country competes against another in a Test series. Now, most senior cricket playing nations will host there own domestic competitions, which are genuinely international competitions open to cricketers and teams from oround the world. Nowhere is this better exemplified that in the Indian Premier League, where a number of team franchises bid for Indian and international players at an auction to build a team that will compete in May/June of each year to win the annual trophy and lucrative prices. The audiences in the huge India stadia are massive, but are dwarfed by the national and international television/online audiences and the betting market associated with the games. Players from around the world flock to the IPL for the money and the fame, confounding the traditional domestic route to cricketing fame and glory - many players prefer to compete in the IPL than to be available for international selection in their own countries. It is a fact of life that national cricketing authorities have had to accept the financial reality of events such as the IPL or the Australian Big Bash or ... And the situation continues to shift, as participation in the IPL is now seen as beneficial to the development of certain or different types of cricketers at international level. There is always something to learn in both directions it seems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets used in this project have been drawn from publicly available international cricket data, setting out individual players' performance in traditional international cricketing formats, while drawing up the publicly availalbe IPL data on the most recent player auction (December 2022 for the 2023 season) and also the IPL's historic player performance data. Furthermore, reference data from international cricket \"salaries\"/retainers is available. \n",
    "\n",
    "The aim is to anaylyse the data to see if a model can be developed to predict accurately the value of the current/upcoming stars of the IPL. Overpaid upstarts or worth their weight in gold? What makes the most valuable IPL player and are they worth it? "

Because players tend to be classed primarily as either Batsmen, Bowlers or All-rounders, we may inevitably have some missing values for batting stats where a player is primarily a bowler, and vice versa. For All-rounders(ie, players who bat and bowl), we have data on both aspects. Wicket-keepers tend also to be batsmen, so we will have batting stats for them. \n",

So, if we can tally up which rows have this level of null data, we can then remove the rows in full. (It would be useful to keep these removed rows, for if we can attach other performance data to them, then we could use this to find what might be a suitable price, particularly for those that were sold, but are IPL first-timers.) Then for the remaining null values we can legitimately assign zero to them. "
